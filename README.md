# Archbox
My personal Arch setup featuring a comfy GNOME desktop and a focused Qtile desktop.
## Installation
Install using the install.txt guide. Much of the setup after the base Arch install can be skipped by running the setup_script.sh file.

Don't forget to make the file executable with `chmod -x install_script.sh`.
